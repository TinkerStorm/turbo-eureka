# turbo-eureka

A bot for handling roles through message components on webhooks (utilizes encoded state).

> Functionality is derived from the [Discohook Utils](https://dutils.shay.cat/) extension service, but is not affiliated with it.
>
> The only aspect that is derived from Discohook Utils is webhook creation, which Discord does not handle natively for bots using interactions.
